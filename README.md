# LRSC -- Learning Record Store Connector

This project allows you to simultaneously deploy three components:
- **LRS (LearningLocker)**
- **LRSC (LRS Connector)** â€“ which enables the PDC to interact with the LRS
- **PDC (PTX Dataspace Connector)**

This document outlines the steps to install, configure, and launch the project in a production environment.

## Global Configuration

1. **DNS Records:** Ensure that the three required A records are set up for LRS, PDC, and LRSC applications.
2. **Environment File:**
    - Copy `.env.default` to `.env` in the project root:
        ```bash
        cp .env.default .env
        ```
    - Modify the necessary values :
        - `LL_DOMAIN_NAME`,
        - `LRSC_DOMAIN_NAME`,
        - `PDC_DOMAIN_NAME`,
        - `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL`,
        - `LL_ORGANIZATION_NAME`,
        - `LL_MASTER_PASSWORD`.

---

## LearningLocker (LL) Configuration

1. Copy the default environment file:
   ```bash
   cp ll/.env.default ll/.env
   ```
2. Modify the configuration as needed.  
**Important:** You must at least change the `APP-SECRET` env variable in the `ll/.env` file.

---

## PDC (PTX Dataspace Connector) Configuration

1. Copy the sample configuration file:
   ```bash
   cp pdc/config.sample.json pdc/config.production.json
   ```
2. Edit `config.production.json`:
   - Fill in the first three fields (`endpoint`, `serviceKey`, `secretKey`).
   - For the last field (`credentials.0.value`): if the LRS is already available, fill it in with the Authorization header given by your LRS; otherwise, we will update it later.

---

## Building and Launching the Project

1. **Build the Project:**
   ```bash
   make build
   ```
   *Note: The build process may take between 1 and 20 minutes depending on your hardware.*

2. **Launch the Project:**
   ```bash
   ENV=prod make up
   ```

3. **Complete LearningLocker Initialization:**
   ```bash
   make ll-init
   ```

---

## Post-Configuration for LearningLocker

1. **Login the your LearningLocker instance:**  
   To log in, use `<<LL_MASTER_EMAIL>>` and `<<LL_MASTER_PASSWORD>>` environment variables.
2. **Create a Store:**  
   To create a store, enter your organization. Then, move to `Settings->Stores`, and click on `+Add New`.
   Creating a `Store` will automatically create a `Client`.
3. **Retrieve the Basic Auth Token:**  
   In the newly created `Client`, retrieve the token (hereafter referred to as `<<BASIC_TOKEN>>`).

---

## Testing the connection between the LRSC and the LRS

Make a test request to your LRS Connector using `curl`:

```bash
curl \
   --location 'https://<<LRSC_DOMAIN_NAME>>/statements?xapi_version=<<XAPI_VERSION>>&xapi_endpoint=<<LL_ENDPOINT>>' \
   --header 'Authorization: <<BASIC_TOKEN>>'
```

**Note:** The `LL_ENDPOINT` must be the URL to the xAPI entry point. For LearningLocker, it is typically: `https://<<LL_DOMAIN_NAME>>/data/xAPI/statements`. For a LRS such as ralph, it would be `https://<<LL_DOMAIN_NAME>>/xAPI/statements`.

**Example:**

```bash
curl \
   --location 'https://lrsc.test.inokufu.space/statements?xapi_version=1.0.3&xapi_endpoint=https://lrs.test.inokufu.space/data/xAPI/statements' \
   --header 'Authorization: <<BASIC_TOKEN>>'
```

---

## Post-Configuration for the PDC

By default, the PDC application can load credentials from the `config.json` (or `config.production.json`) file. In our case, it comes with empty credentials (an `apiKey` type) that needs to be updated with the `<<BASIC_TOKEN>>` obtained from LearningLocker.

You can update the credentials using one of the following methods:

### Using the Swagger

1. **Access the Swagger UI:**  
   Open your PDC instance in a browser at: `https://<<PDC_DOMAIN_NAME>>/docs`
2. **Login:**
   - Scroll down to the login route.
   - Submit a POST request containing your `<<SERVICE_KEY>>` and `<<SECRET_KEY>>` (available in the Catalog).  
      This request will return a token (`<<JWT_TOKEN>>`).
3. **Authorize:**
   - Copy the `<<JWT_TOKEN>>`.
   - Scroll back to the top of the Swagger, and click on the **Authorize** button in the top right corner.
   - Paste the token in the `jwt` field and click **Authorize**.
4. **Update Credentials:**
   - Scroll down to the **Update Credentials** route.
   - Submit the following PUT request (replace `<<BASIC_TOKEN>>` with your actual token):
     - **Credential ID:** `67375ec5f29f0c5a15265de5`.
     - **Request Body:**
       ```json
       {"type": "apiKey", "key": "Authorization", "value": "<<BASIC_TOKEN>>"}
       ```

### Using the Console

1. **Retrieve the JWT Token:**
   ```bash
   curl 'https://<<PDC_DOMAIN_NAME>>/login' \
      -X 'POST' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data '{"serviceKey": "<<SERVICE_KEY>>", "secretKey": "<<SECRET_KEY>>"}'
   ```
   *Extract the `<<JWT_TOKEN>>` from the response (`response->content->token`).*

2. **Update the Credential:**
   ```bash
   curl 'https://<<PDC_DOMAIN_NAME>>/private/credentials/67375ec5f29f0c5a15265de5' \
      -X 'PUT' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer <<JWT_TOKEN>>' \
      --data '{"type": "apiKey", "key": "Authorization", "value": "<<BASIC_TOKEN>>"}'
   ```

## Configure a Data or Service Resource in the VisionsTrust Catalog

- **Create a `Data (Service) Resource`.**
- In the **Personal Data** section, check the `Personal Data` box.
- In the **Tech** section:
  - **Data Representation**
    1. **Source Type:** `REST`
    2. **URL:**  
       `https://<<LRSC_DOMAIN_NAME>>/statements?xapi_version=<<XAPI_VERSION>>&xapi_endpoint=<<LL_ENDPOINT>>&agent={userId}`  
       **Example:**  
       `https://lrsc.test.inokufu.space/statements?xapi_version=1.0.3&xapi_endpoint=https://lrs.test.inokufu.space/data/xAPI/statements&agent={userId}`  
       **Note:** Ensure that you include the agent query parameter (`{userId}`) toe enable personal data exchanges.
  - **Security**
    1. **Select:** `Api-Key`
    2. **Credential Identifier:** `67375ec5f29f0c5a15265de5`  
       (This corresponds to the PDC credential containing the LearningLocker `<<BASIC_TOKEN>>` authentication.)
- **Validate the creation of the resource.**

## Launching a Data Exchange through the PDC

To initiate a data exchange through the PDC, you can use the `/consumer/exchange` endpoint.  
This process assumes that a data sharing agreement contract has already been established between the parties involved.  
For more information about the Data Exchange process, please refer to the [documentation of the dataspace-connector](https://github.com/Prometheus-X-association/dataspace-connector/blob/main/docs/DATA_EXCHANGE.md).

### Steps to Launch a Data Exchange

The Data Exchange must be launched by submitting a POST request.  
In this section, we will first describe how to build the payload, and then explain how to submit this POST request.

1. **Payload Requirements:**

   The payload for this request varies depending on the type of contract being enforced.  
   Below are the details for the `Ecosystem` and `Bilateral` contract types.

   For the Ecosystem contract type:
   ```jsonc
   {
      // URI of the contract where the exchange is based
      // REQUIRED
      "contract": "https://contract.com/contracts/id", // "contract": "https://contract.visionstrust.com/contracts/<<CONTRACT_ID>>",
      // Consumer service offering URI
      // REQUIRED
      "purposeId": "https://catalog.api.com/v1/catalog/serviceofferings/<<CONSUMER_SERVICE_OFFERING_ID>>",
      // Provider service offering URI
      // REQUIRED
      "resourceId": "https://catalog.api.com/v1/catalog/serviceofferings/<<PROVIDER_SERVICE_OFFERING_ID>>",

      // Provider params applied at all the provider data resources
      // OPTIONAL
      "providerParams": {
         "query": [
            {
               "page": 2 // Example
            },
            {
               "limit": 20 // Example
            }
         ]
      },
      // Selected resources with needed params
      // OPTIONAL
      "resources": [
         {
            "resource": "https://api.catalog.com/v1/catalog/dataresources/<<PROVIDER_RESOURCE_ID>>",
            "params": {
               "query": [
                  {
                     "page": 2 // Example
                  },
                  {
                     "limit": 20 // Example
                  }
               ]
            }
         }
      ]
   }
   ```

   **Note:** For bilateral contracts, the payload is the same, except for the `purposeId` and `resourceId` fields, which are only needed for ecosystem contracts.

2. **Request the Data Exchange Trigger:**

   Use the following `curl` command to request a data exchange. This can be initiated by either the Data Provider or the Data Consumer.

   You first need to be authenticated to the PDC. Please refer to the first subsections of [this section](#post-configuration-for-the-pdc) for a step by step description on how to login.

   ```bash
   curl 'https://<<PDC_DOMAIN_NAME>>/consumer/exchange' \
      -X 'POST' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer <<JWT_TOKEN>>' \
      --data '' # Check the previous subsection to know how to build the payload.
   ```

   **Note:** Replace `<<PDC_DOMAIN_NAME>>` with the actual domain name of your PDC instance, and `<<JWT_TOKEN>>` by your authentication token.

   Alternatively, you can use the Swagger UI of your PDC (reachable at `https://<<PDC_DOMAIN_NAME>>/docs`) to initiate the data exchange. Scroll down to the `Consumer` section, route `/consumer/exchange`, and submit the POST request with the appropriate payload.
